# Alzheimerâ€™s Detection Web App
This is a Streamlit-based web application that uses a deep learning model (ResNet18 trained on grayscale MRI images) to classify Alzheimerâ€™s disease stages.

## How to run
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
2. Run the app
streamlit run app.py

## ðŸ“Œ Next Steps for You
1. Create this folder structure on your system.  
2. Put the placeholder code in each file.  
3. Run it:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
â†’ Youâ€™ll see a home page, an About page, and an Upload page (without ML yet).

4. Once thatâ€™s running smoothly, share your model file (.pth) with me.

Iâ€™ll check whether it was saved with state_dict or full model.

Then weâ€™ll update upload_predict.py to load the model and actually give predictions.
